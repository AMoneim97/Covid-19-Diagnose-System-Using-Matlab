Covid-19 Diagnose System Using Matlab

The study discusses the proposed method implemented to detect the pneumonia infection from CTSI. The various stages involved in the proposed technique are presented in Figure 1. Initially, the two-dimensional CTSI is collected from the database. The CTSI is associated with the lung section along with the artifacts, such as the bone and other body sections. The threshold filler is used to separate the lungs from the body.
